# Vehicle-Movement-Analysis-and-Insight-Generation-in-a-College-Campus-using-Edge-AI

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop an Edge AI-
based solution that can analyze vehicle movement in and out 
of a college campus using data from cameras capturing vehicle 
photos and license plates. The solution should provide insights 
on vehicle movement patterns, parking occupancy, and match 
vehicles to an approved vehicle database.

This repository contains a Python-based project that analyzes vehicle movement using . The system provides insights such as vehicle counts, traffic flow, parking availability, and potential congestion areas by processing video feeds. 
It employs computer vision, machine learning, and edge AI technologies for real-time analysis and offers potential campus planning, traffic management, and security applications.
